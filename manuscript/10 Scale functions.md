# Scale Functions

Scale functions help you transform your **data values** into **visual values**.

**Data values** are the values of your data. For example, in Energy Explorer the data values are the percentage values for each of the four energy types.

**Visual values** are visual properties such as position, size and colour. For example an x coordinate of `50px`, a height of `100px` or a colour of `#aaa`.

Suppose you have an array of numbers representing percentage values:

```js
let data = [15, 76, 41, 67, 97];
```

and you want to create a bar chart where the maximum length of the bars is `500px`.

A scale function which takes a number between 0 and 100 and returns a value between 0 and 500 would help here and D3 can create it for you. This saves you having to figure out the mathematics and code yourself.

D3 has around twelve scale types. Some accept **numbers** as input, others accept **strings**. Some output **numbers**, others ouput **colours**. In this book we cover two scale types `scaleLinear` and `scaleSqrt`.

`scaleLinear` is by far the most common D3 scale type and has several use cases. `scaleSqrt` is particularly useful when working with circles. We’ll use it to size circles in Energy Explorer.

## scaleLinear

`d3.scaleLinear` creates linear scale functions. A linear scale takes a **number** as input and returns a **number**. Use the following to create a very simple linear scale function:

```
let myScale = d3.scaleLinear();
```

The return value of `d3.scaleLinear` is a function (which we've assigned to `myScale`). By default this function takes an input value and returns the same value:

```js
myScale(0);    // returns 0
myScale(1);    // returns 1
myScale(50);   // returns 50
myScale(100);  // returns 100
```

Not very useful, but you can define the input and output ranges using `.domain` and `.range`, respectively. D3’s terminology uses **domain** to represent the input minimum and maximum and **range** to represent the output minimum and maximum. Let’s set the domain to between 0 and 100 and the range to between 0 and 1000:

```js
myScale.domain([0, 100]).range([0, 1000]);
```

(You pass an array with two values into `.domain` and `.range`. The first value is the minimum and the second value the maximum.)

Now look at the output values:

```js
myScale(0);    // returns 0
myScale(1);    // returns 10
myScale(50);   // returns 500
myScale(100);  // returns 1000
```

Our linear scale function `myScale` takes an input between 0 and 100 (the domain) and linearly maps it to an output between 0 and 1000 (the range).

D>If you plot the output against the input of a **linear** scale you get a straight line.

You can also pass colours into the range:

```js
myScale.range(['white', 'red']);
```

This results in:

```js
myScale(0);    // returns "rgb(255, 255, 255)"
myScale(1);    // returns "rgb(255, 252, 252)"
myScale(50);   // returns "rgb(255, 128, 128)"
myScale(100);  // returns "rgb(255, 0, 0)"
```

Now the scale is returning colours ranging from white (`rgb(255, 255, 255)`) to red (`rgb(255, 0, 0)`). By default D3 scale functions extrapolate the output if you input values outside of the domain:

```js
myScale.domain([0, 100]).range([0, 1000]);
myScale(200);   // returns 2000
myScale(-100);  // returns -1000
```

However you can ‘clamp’ the scale function so that the output stays within the range:

```js
myScale.clamp(true);
myScale(200);  // returns 1000
myScale(-100);  // returns 0
```

You can try out `scaleLinear` at jsconsole.com by visiting [https://jsconsole.com](https://jsconsole.com). First include D3 using jsconsole.com’s `:load` command:

```js
:load https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/7.4.4/d3.min.js
```

Then type (or copy and paste) the following:

```js
let myScale = d3.scaleLinear();
myScale.domain([0, 100]).range([0, 1000]);
```

Now if you enter `myScale(0)` you should see `0` output. If you enter `myScale(100)` you should see `1000` output.

## scaleSqrt

`d3.scaleSqrt` is similar to `d3.scaleLinear` except the **square root** of the input value is used. This is particularly useful when using circles to represent a quantity. It’s widely accepted when visualising data that the **area** of a circle (rather than the radius of a circle) should be proportional to a value. This potentially tricky calculation is taken care of by D3’s `scaleSqrt` scale. Suppose we have a value that varies between 0 and 1 and we wish to represent it with a circle with maximum radius 100 we create a square root scale using:

```js
let myScale = d3.scaleSqrt().domain([0, 1]).range([0, 100]);
myScale(0.5);  // returns 70.71067811865476
myScale(1);  // returns 100
```

D> Recalling circle mathematics, the area of a circle is `pi * radius * radius`. Thus the area of a circle representing a value of 0.5 is `pi * 70.7106 * 70.7106 = 15707.96` and the area of the circle representing 1 is `pi * 100 * 100 = 31415.93`. The second circle is twice the area of the first circle.

The main thing to remember is that if you’re using circle area to represent a value, use `scaleSqrt`.

## Putting scale functions to use

Consider the following code which performs a data join and sets the circle radius according to the joined value:

```js
let myData = [10, 40, 30];

d3.select('g.chart')
  .selectAll('circle')
  .data(myData)
  .join('circle')
  .attr('r', function(d) {
    return d;
  });
```

This scales the circle **radius** proportionally to the joined value `d`. As we’ve just discussed this isn’t recommended – you should scale **area** proportionally to the joined value.

This is achieved by applying a `scaleSqrt` scale:

```js
let myData = [10, 40, 30];
markua-start-insert
let radiusScale = d3.scaleSqrt().domain([0, 50]).range([0, 50]);
markua-end-insert

d3.select('g.chart')
  .selectAll('circle')
  .data(myData)
  .join('circle')
  .attr('r', function(d) {
markua-start-insert
    return radiusScale(d);
markua-end-insert
  });
```

Notice that the function passed into `.attr` is now using `radiusScale`.

Here’s a similar example in CodePen: [https://codepen.io/createwithdata/pen/yLeqRLp](https://codepen.io/createwithdata/pen/yLeqRLp) The second data value (40) is twice the first data value (20). This results in the second circle having twice the area of the first circle.

Now change `scaleSqrt` to `scaleLinear` in the CodePen example. When `scaleLinear` is used it’s fairly clear that the second circle’s area is much more than twice the first circle’s, even though its value is only 2 times bigger. We’ll use `scaleSqrt` to set the circle sizes in the Energy Explorer in the following practical.
